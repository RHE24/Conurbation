== **Conurbation** ==

Conurbation started off as an exploration exercise on adding regional areas to CityWorld. 
Now the code base has diverged enough that I am not sure the two project will ever come together again. 
This might be for the best as some folks want a world full of city and others want more regional variety. 
Only time will tell if the two project will merge again… hard to tell.

===== //Version 0.03// ===== 
,,//(sometimes there is a delay in getting the new version of the plugin through the approval process, if the above version isn't available check back in an hour or so)//,,
 
=== Alpha ===
This is an Alpha of the new plugin. 
There are numerous continuity issues and none of the very simple buildings have “doors”, “stairs”, etc… those features will show up in future releases.
I am looking for feedback on the new generator, the forums have got some "prepopulated" threads on specific areas.
Feel free to add your comments to them or add a new thread, thanks.

==== Technical info ====
* v0.03 Added config.yml options to control if farms, residential or urban areas are generated. If that area is not generated a sculpted forest will be generated instead.
* v0.02 Initial release

Permissions for Conurbation command (used your favorite perms plugin)
* Conurbation.command (defaults to op)

Config option file is now generated when Conurbation runs. 
These options only affect "new generation" and are not world specific (yet). 
Changing them after a world has been generated will produce some odd results at times.
* Global.StreetLevel (defaults to -1) //where does the street generate, -1 means halfway between as low as it can get and as high as it can get// 
* Global.SeabedLevel (defaults to -1) //where does the seabed generate, -1 means 1/4 of the distance allows down from the street level//
* Global.DecrepitLevel (defaults to 0.1) //how "decayed" is the generation. for now this only effects streetlights, farms and parks//
* Global.IncludeAgricultureZones (defaults to true) //generate farms or not. if not then sculpted forests will generated instead// 
* Global.IncludeResidentialZones (defaults to true) //generate houses or not. if not then sculpted forests will generated instead// 
* Global.IncludeUrbanZones (defaults to true) //generate city buildings or not. if not then sculpted forests will generated instead// 

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. 
In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new Conurbation (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. 
This is especially obvious if you are flying around. Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. 
What I recommend is take a tour of your world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.

=== Installing ===

This is purely a world generator. 
If you need teleportation or world management support there are plenty of plugins that will do that for you. 
The Bukkit plugin ecosystem does not need more of those puppies. 
This is JUST A WORLD GENERATOR. :-)

To install it you will need to do three things...
# **Download the plugin and place it in Bukkit's plugin folder.** If you don't know where or what the Bukkit's plugin folder is, read [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].
# **Now start up Minecraft Server via Bukkit.** If you don't know how to do this, I recommend rereading [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].

At this point, you may be asking yourself: **How do I get to the city?** 
There are two options...
# **Press "T", type in "/Conurbation" and press return (if you do this, remember that some plugins might not work with Conurbation until you modify bukkit's YML to include a reference to the world)
# **OR... you can use a multiverse plugin and use the Conurbation as the generator for one of your worlds. We use [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiverse-core/|Multiverse]].

If you are still confused then rereread [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]]. :-)
